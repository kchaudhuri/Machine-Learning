Finding Donors for CharityML

This project was a part of the Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

Employed supervised learning algorithms to estimate income of an individual for predicting possible donors for a charity, using census data with scikit-learn library

Applied and compared Support Vector Classifiers, Random Forest Classifier and Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers to get the best results with a final accuracy of 83.78% and F-score of 68.35

Found important features for the classifier to work efficiently
