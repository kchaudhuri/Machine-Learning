Dog Breed Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

•	Experimented and built a convolutional neural network using Keras to identify a particular dog breed from amongst 133 categories with a data set of 8351 pictures of dog species

•	The achieved accuracy of the neural network is 3% with 10 epochs

•	Analyzed different CNN architectures such as VGG16, VGG19 and Resnet to improve the current neural network performance
