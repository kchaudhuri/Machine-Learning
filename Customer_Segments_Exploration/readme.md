Creating Customer Segments from Unlabeled Customer Data

•	Started by visualizing the feature distributions, then by logarithmic feature scaling a better representation of the data is achieved

•	Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for drawing out the underlying structure of the customer data

•	Used K-means clustering algorithm to segment transformed customer data to identify hidden customer segments for distributors

This project was a part of the Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
