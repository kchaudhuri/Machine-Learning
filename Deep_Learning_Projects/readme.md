This folder contains all the projects I have worked on, right from Convolutional Neural Networks to Sequence Models.

- Hand Sign Recognizer
•	Constructed a fully connected six-layer network to detect and classify five hand signs using TensorFlow
•	Used Xavier initializer for initializing weights and Adam optimizer for taking advantage of stochastic gradient descent. 
•	With 1400 epochs a testing accuracy of 71.6 was achieved
